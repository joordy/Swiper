# Datingapp Feature

Hello there! 

My datingapp feature made for a school project. With this feature it will be possible to like people, and when you have a match, you can find them again in an overview. Later in the project I will collaborate with other students to make the dating app up and running. 

To read the process of creating the like feature, and about the whole dating app, you can have a look in [my Wiki](https://github.com/joordy/datingapp-feature/wiki).


## Getting started

When you already have a connection with [Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html), and installed [NodeJs](https://www.webucator.com/how-to/how-install-nodejs-on-mac.cfm) on your computer you can easilly download my project. If you haven't already installed these programs, I recommend to do that first.

### 1. Clone repository

You can clone my repository by typing the following command in your command-line:

`git clone https://github.com/joordy/datingapp-feature.git`


### 2. Install Node modules

The package.json file contains all the required modules. You can install all the necessary modules (dependencies) with the following command:

`npm install`


### 3. Run! 

You can start the node-server now with the command:

`npm run start`

You can visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view the application.
